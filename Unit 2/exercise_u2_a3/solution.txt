For each of the following <p> elements, list all the CSS rules that apply to its color, identify the final applied value, and explain why that value is used.

For <p id="mission">
List all rules that apply to its color.
#mission (1,0,0){
    color: darkorange;
}
.text (0,1,0){
    color: #555;
}
p (0,0,1){
    color: black
}
What is the final color, and why?
it's darkorange, because the id (#mission) is the most specific selector


For <p id="team">
List all rules that apply to its color.
<p id="team" class="text" style="color: darkblue;">
.text (0,1,0){
    color: #555;
}
p (0,0,1){
    color: black
}
What is the final color, and why?
it's darkblue, because the inline style has more priority
because of its location in the html.


For <p id="experience">
List all rules that apply to its color.
.text (0,1,0){
    color: #555;
}
p (0,0,1){
    color: black
}
#experience (1,0,0) {
    color: darkgray;
}
#about p:last-child (1,1,1) {
    color: green;
}
What is the final color, and why?
it's green, because the last selector has the highest
specificity score.


For <p id="services-intro">
List all rules that apply to its color.
p (0,0,1){
    color: black
}
.text (0,1,0) {
    color: #555;
}
.intro (0,1,0) {
    color: blue;
}
What is the final color, and why?
It's blue because, since we have two classes with the same
specificity, the last one is the one that applies.


For <p id="offer">
List all rules that apply to its color.
<p id="offer" class="text" style="color: darkblue;
#offer (1,0,0) {
    color: darkgreen !important;
}
p (0,0,1){
    color: black
}
.text (0,1,0) {
    color: #555;
}
What is the final color, and why?
it's darkgreen, because although we have an inline style in the
html, we have the flag !important in the id #offer that makes
it more priority.
